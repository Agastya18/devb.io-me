# CONTRIBUTING.md

Thank you for your interest in contributing to devb.io! This guide will help you understand how to contribute to both the frontend and backend components of our project.

## üåü Project Overview

devb.io is a platform that automatically generates professional developer portfolios from GitHub profiles, using AI to enhance professional representations. The project consists of:

- **Frontend**: NextJS application (in the `/www` directory)
- **Backend**: FastAPI application (in the `/api` directory)
- **Caching**: Redis for performance optimization

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 18+ and npm/pnpm
- Redis (for local development)
- Git

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Fork the Repository:**
   Click the Fork button on GitHub to create your own copy.

2. **Clone Your Fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/devb.io.git
   cd devb.io
   ```

3. **Create a New Branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## üîß Backend Setup (FastAPI)

1. **Install Python Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Environment Variables:**
   - Copy the example environment file and modify as needed
   - Required variables include API keys and configuration settings

3. **Run the Backend Server:**

   uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

4. **Access the API Documentation:**
   - Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc

### Backend Development Guidelines

1. **Code Structure:**
   - Place new API endpoints in the appropriate modules
   - Follow the existing pattern for route definitions
   - Use dependency injection for shared resources

2. **Error Handling:**
   - Use FastAPI's HTTPException for API errors
   - Include descriptive error messages
   - Implement proper status codes

3. **Testing:**
   - Write tests using pytest
   - Run tests with `pytest` command
   - Ensure test coverage for new features

4. **Performance Considerations:**
   - Use caching where appropriate
   - Implement async functions for I/O bound operations
   - Consider rate limiting for external API calls

## üíª Frontend Setup (NextJS)

1. **Install Node Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd www
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Environment Variables:**
   - Copy `www/example.env` to `www/.env.local`
   - Update the API endpoint and other required variables

3. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. **Access the Frontend:**
   - Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

### Frontend Development Guidelines

1. **Code Structure:**
   - Follow the Next.js app router structure
   - Place components in the appropriate directories
   - Use client and server components appropriately

2. **Styling:**
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Follow the existing design system
   - Ensure responsive design

3. **State Management:**
   - Use Zustand for client state management (Only if necessary)
   - Follow existing patterns for data fetching

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement proper error boundaries
   - Use the retry mechanism for API calls (especially for LinkedIn data)
   - Display user-friendly error messages

5. **Performance:**
   - Optimize images and assets
   - Use proper loading states and skeletons
   - Implement proper caching strategies

## üß™ Testing

### Backend Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=api
```

### Frontend Testing

```bash
# Run linting
cd www
pnpm lint
```
